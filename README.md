+ [API work in Python](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/mashup.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding challenge from Saffron Digital.  The script gets the popular music artists through Yahoo search API, then finds all of the artists' albums through LastFM API, sorts the information and spits everything out in JSON format all in about 10 seconds.

+ [Responsive web design in JS and CSS](https://github.com/iepathos/wyomafilms) is a portfolio site I created for video production company, Wyoma Films.  It is an example of responsive web design.  The HTML and CSS, combined with bootstrap.js, adapt the layout from regular computer screens, to tablets, to smartphones.

+ [Logic work in Python](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/bestbefore.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding puzzle from Spotify.  The script reads an ambiguous date from a file and prints the earliest possible expiration date between the years 2000 and 3000.
