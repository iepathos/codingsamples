+ [API work in Python](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/mashup.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding challenge from Saffron Digital.  The script finds all of the popular music artists through Yahoo search API, then finds all of the artists' albums through LastFM API.  It finds the album name, a medium-sized image link of the album cover and the play counts for each album.  Then it spits everything out in JSON format.  One of the requirements for the challenge were that the script executes in less than 30 seconds.  My script only takes about 10 seconds.

+ [Django and SQL Database creation](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/populate.py) I created this script for a startup website I'm working on.  This script populates a SQL database with all of the categories from the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities and all of the non-profit organizations in the US from the IRS pub78 release.

+ [Guidestar Database Information Scraping](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/guidestar.py) This script works with the database created from the previous script.  It updates the non-profit organizations in the database with information from the Guidestar database.  It categorizes the npo's based on the categories Guidestar has assigned.

+ [Logic work in Python](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/bestbefore.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding puzzle from Spotify.  The script reads an ambiguous date from a file and prints the earliest possible expiration date between the years 2000 and 3000.
