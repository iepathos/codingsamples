Enthusiasm about open source, open data and open knowledge.  Results-driven self-starter comfortable working independently and in a team environment.  Self-motivated with a passion for learning new and improved techniques.  I'm a coder with a love for automation, end-user experience and cross-platform compatibility.

+ [mashup.py](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/mashup.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding challenge from Saffron Digital.  The script gets the popular music artists through Yahoo search api, then finds all of the artists' albums through LastFM api, sorts the information and spits everything out in JSON format all in about 15 seconds.

+ [bestbefore.py](https://github.com/iepathos/codingsamples/blob/master/bestbefore.py) is a python script I wrote in response to a coding puzzle from Spotify.  The script reads an ambiguous date from a file and prints the earliest possible expiration date between the years 2000 and 3000.
